There was a need to have a set of tools to be used while creating Portals.

We've made available an SDK so that you can design your Portal's components quickly.

It can be used anywhere on the system, but it mostly used on Workspaces.

The SDK is made of namespaces, where each one aggregates several methods.

This documentation makes available all the available namespaces and methods to be used.

```javascript
function example(e) {
    SW.{namespace}.{method}();
}
```
